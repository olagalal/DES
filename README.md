This repo is implementation of Data Encryption Standard algorithm in Java based on this [document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s9gYIRWmMfyL_lAoCODR6So2UCCRbQr-/view?usp=sharing). It was made for **(Security - Forth Year)** in my college. The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of electronic data. Although its short key length of 56 bits, criticized from the beginning, makes it too insecure for most current applications, it was highly influential in the advancement of modern cryptography.

This implementation of DES is not optimized in any way. The code has been written to provide readability and easy understanding of the algorithm.
